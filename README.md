## FAN Model Benchmarking Framework
A robust framework for evaluating and comparing Fourier Analysis Network performance across signal processing tasks.

### Overview
This framework enables systematic performance comparison of Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) models on various signal types with different data transformations. It leverages MLflow for experiment tracking and visualization.
